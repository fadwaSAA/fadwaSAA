I'm Fadwa Alaskar. I'm a researcher in artificial intelligence and a developer. I'm interested in deep learning applications in signal and image processing. 
I'm currently working on projects related to autonomous vehicles and traffic management. 
I always look for new opportunities that help me be a better version of myself!
